Development
===========

To contribute to `pytest-html` you can use `Pipenv`_ to manage a python virtual environment and
`pre-commit`_ to help you with styling and formatting.

To setup the virtual environment and pre-commit, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pipenv install --dev
  $ pipenv run pre-commit install

If you're not using `Pipenv`_, run the following to install `pre-commit`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install pre-commit
  $ pre-commit install


Automated Testing
-----------------

All pull requests and merges are tested in `GitHub Actions`_ which are defined inside ``.github`` folder.

To retrigger CI to run again for a pull request, you either use dropdown option, close and reopen pull-request
or to just update the branch containing it.

You can do this with `git commit --allow-empty`

Running Tests
-------------

Python
~~~~~~

You will need `Tox`_ installed to run the tests against the supported Python versions. If you're using `Pipenv`_
it will be installed for you.

With `Pipenv`_, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pipenv run tox

Otherwise, to install and run, do:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install tox
  $ tox

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

You will need `npm`_ installed to run the JavaScript tests. Internally, we use `Grunt`_ and `QUnit`_ to run the tests.

Once `npm`_ is installed, you can install all needed dependencies by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npm install

Run the following to execute the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npm test

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs`_, and is written in `RST`_. Remember to add any new files to the :code:`toctree`
section in :code:`index.rst`.

To build your documentation, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tox -e docs

You can then run a local webserver to verify your changes compiled correctly.

SASS/SCSS/CSS
-------------

You will need `npm`_ installed to compile the CSS, which is generated via `SASS/SCSS`_.

Once `npm`_ is installed, you can install all needed dependencies by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npm install

Run the following to build the application:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npm run build

Releasing a new version
-----------------------

Follow these steps to release a new version of the project:

#.  Update your local master with the upstream master (``git pull --rebase upstream master``)
#.  Create a new branch
#.  Update `the changelog`_ with the new version, today's date, and all changes/new features
#.  Commit and push the new branch and then create a new pull request
#.  Wait for tests and reviews and then merge the branch
#.  Once merged, update your local master again (``git pull --rebase upstream master``)
#.  Tag the release with the new release version (``git tag v<new tag>``)
#.  Push the tag (``git push upstream --tags``)
#. Done. Check `Github Actions`_ for release progress.
